# Macro Facial Expressions detection using keras
- This is the result work of Nvidia Fundamental of Deep Learning Course where I learned the basics of deep learning.
- To run this project, make sure to setup a tensorflow environment with Anaconda and download CUDA-toolkit and cudnn.
- I used Tensorflow Keras to:
  - train an american sign language model with cnn and data augmentation
  - train a presidential dog classification with transfer learning from vgg16 Image Net.
  - train a headline generator from new york times headlines with NLP and RNN.
