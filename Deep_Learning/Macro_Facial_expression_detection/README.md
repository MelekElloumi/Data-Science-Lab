# Macro Facial Expressions detection using keras
- This is the result work of this coursera [guided project](https://www.coursera.org/projects/facial-expression-recognition-keras) where i learned how to build a computer vision model using Tensorflow Keras and applying it on a webcam feed with OpenCV.
- To run this project, make sure to setup a tensorflow environment with Anaconda and download CUDA-toolkit and cudnn.
- This jupyter notebook will build the model then run main.py to launch the flask app
- Download the [FER](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge/data)
dataset from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CE22Y8wFo1QcDWg5BNqv6HQ3COubzlVR/view?usp=sharing). It's devided into a train and test folder, each one contains 7 folders marking
the different emotions.
